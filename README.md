## üìå Abstract
Design and fabrication of a custom PCB integrating ESP32 microcontroller with DHT11 (temperature/humidity) and MQ135 (AQI) sensors. Data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to cloud platforms for real-time visualization and analysis. Features low-power design supporting both stationary and battery-powered deployments.

## ‚ú® Features
- Real-time environmental monitoring
- Custom low-noise PCB design
- Wi-Fi connectivity (HTTP/MQTT)
- Cloud integration (ThingSpeak/Blynk)
- Power-optimized for battery operation
- Threshold-based alerts
